# Gatsby Theme Woocommerce

This is a Gatsby theme for displaying products from a Wordpress Woocommerce instance.

See the [live demo](https://gatsby-theme-jam-example.netlify.com)

## Features

The theme isn't yet a fully functioning ecommerce site with the ability to checkout, but instead it is a proof of concept of what can be done with Woocommmerce and Gatsby. The following features are available in the theme:

-   All Products Page
-   Paginated Products page
-   Simple Product Page
-   External Product Page
-   Local Storage MiniCart

## Installation

This is the mono repo containing the demo **and** the theme. Check the [theme-specific README](gatsby-theme-woocommerce/README.md) for further
details on the theme.

In case you want to work with this mono repo (for local development, pull requests, etc.):

1. Clone / fork the repository and `cd` into the directory

2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies

3. Run `yarn workspace site develop` to start the demo locally.
